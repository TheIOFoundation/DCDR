## About

**Data-Centric Digital Rights** (DCDR) is the advocacy of protecting citizens' Rights by transparently implementing the regulations that should protect them.

As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the NextGen Rights Defenders and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting citizen's digital twins.&#x20;

The **DCDR Principles** put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
