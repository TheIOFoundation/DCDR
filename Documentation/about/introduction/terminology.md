The Representational Entity for a collection of one or more Source Entities, represented by their Digital Identities.

### **Digital domain (DD)**

@@@Definition of the digital world from the perspective of the technology.

### Data-Centric Digital Rights (DCDR) \[advocacy]

The advocacy bringing forward the observance of the Digital Rights to be applied over data to protect it from its undue usage or extinction.

### Data-Centric Digital Rights Principles (DCDR Principles)

### Digital Identity (DID) <a href="#_1w4zshgdaoek" id="_1w4zshgdaoek"></a>

### Digital Harmful Action (DHA)

Any algorithmic decision that will result in the occurrence of a Digital Harm.

### Digital Harmful Outcome (DHO)

The resulting damaging outcome, be it over the Representational Entity or its Source Entity, that will result in Digital or Physical Harm.

### Digital Right (DR)

An algorithmic action that proactively prevents the occurrence of a Digital Harm on a given data point.
