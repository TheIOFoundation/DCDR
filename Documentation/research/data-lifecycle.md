## About

A research focused on establishing a technical description on the nature of data and its lifecycle.

## The Data Lifecycle

{% hint style="info" %}
The DCDR Data Lifecycle is based on the [DCDR Framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework).
{% endhint %}

A core component of the DCDR Framework and its implementation is to provide clarity concerning the nature of data and its lifecycle. The objective is to ensure a baseline model to identify the Digital Harms that data can undergo during said lifecycle so that technologists can use it as a reference.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Data exists in a fully digital space. Understanding data manipulation requires understanding its lifecycle.**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The DCDR Data Lifecycle informs the work for the [DCDR Digital Harms](https://tiof.click/DCDRDataLifecycle).
{% endhint %}
