**NOTICE**

The DCDR Framework is currently a work in progress.
{% endhint %}

## About

A research focused on establishing a technical description of the Harms that can be applied to data across its lifecycle.

## The Digital Harms Taxonomy

{% hint style="info" %}
The [DCDR Data Lifecycle](https://tiof.click/DCDRDataLifecycle) informs the work for the DCDR Digital Harms.
{% endhint %}

The next step in the DCDR Framework is establishing the different Harms a data structure can be subjected to and arrange it under a taxonomy.

For technologists to adopt a Rights-protecting paradigm, they need to be able to technically describe the different Digital Harms they will want to avoid and, as a result the, Digital Rights they wish to observe.

### Defining a Digital Harm

In the DCDR Framework, a Harm is any OPERATION that shortens an OBJECT Lifecycle (in TIME).

{% hint style="info" %}
The DCDR Digital Harms informs the work for the [DCDR Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRights).
{% endhint %}

### Licensing and distribution

As all materials created by The IO Foundation, the [Digital Harms Taxonomy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarms), a component of the [DCDR Framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework), is published under TIOF Public Licensing Model.

### Revisions

The Digital Harms Taxonomy, as any other component of the [DCDR advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDocs), is subjected to improvements.

### How to contribute

Anyone wishing to submit an improvement to the Digital Harms Taxonomy, can do so via the [Digital Harms Taxonomy folder](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarmsContribute) in the [DCDR repository](https://tiof.click/DCDRRepo).

## Outcomes

* Establish a working group to research on the Digital Harms Taxonomy based on the [Data lifecycle](https://tiof.click/DCDRDataLifecycle)
* Produce a research paper documenting the Digital Harms taxonomy
* Design a syllabus for the dissemination of the Digital Harms taxonomy
* Promote the awareness and understanding of the research results
* Incorporate the research's results in the [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRDocs)
