**NOTICE**

The DCDR Framework is currently a work in progress.

## About

A research focused on establishing a technical description of the Rights that need to be applied to data to extend its lifecycle.

## The Digital Rights Taxonomy

{% hint style="info" %}
The DCDR Digital Harms informs the work for the DCDR Digital Rights.
{% endhint %}

The next step in the DCDR Framework is establishing the different Rights to be proactively applied over a data structure to expand an object's lifecycle to and arrange it under a taxonomy.

For technologists to adopt a Rights-protecting paradigm, they need to be able to technically describe the different Digital Harms they will want to avoid and, as a result the, Digital Rights they wish to observe.

### Defining a Digital Right

In the DCDR Framework, a Right is any OPERATION that _does not result_ in a HARM over an OBJECT Lifecycle (in TIME).

### Licensing and distribution

As all materials created by The IO Foundation, the [Digital Rights Taxonomy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRights), a component of the [DCDR Framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework), is published under TIOF Public Licensing Model.

### Revisions

The Digital Rights Taxonomy, as any other component of the [DCDR advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDocs), is subjected to improvements.

### How to contribute

Anyone wishing to submit an improvement to the Digital Rights Taxonomy, can do so via the [Digital Rights Taxonomy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRightsContribute) folder in the [DCDR repository](https://tiof.click/DCDRRepo).

## Outcomes

* Establish a working group to research on the Digital Rights Taxonomy based on the [Digital Harms Taxonomy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarms)
* Produce a research paper documenting the Digital Rights taxonomy
* Design a syllabus for the dissemination of the Digital Rights taxonomy
* Promote the awareness and understanding of the research results
* Incorporate the research's results in the [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRDocs)
