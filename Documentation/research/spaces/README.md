## About

Spaces are the environments in which a number objects interact with each other through events by means of messages that are exchanged through channels at a given cost.

Spaces differentiate through their properties. The DCDR Framework consisders 3 Spaces, which provide a global working area in the objective of protecting people's rights and their data, namely:

* The Physical Space
* Mental Spaces
* Digital Spaces

## Comparing spaces

An initial comparison of Spaces would provide the following insights:

| Space      | Physical      | Mental                       | Digital                      |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Source     |  Itself       | <p>Physical<br>(Organic)</p> | <p>Mental<br>(Synthetic)</p> |
| Dimensions | X, Y, Z, Time | Time                         | Operations                   |
| Shared     |               | No                           | Potentially                  |

Source: Determines from which space a given space is derived and its nature.

Dimensions: The list of applicable dimensions that affect the objects in a given space.

Shared: Is the data in the twin shared by several algorithms at a time?\
In other words, can the twin be isolated from external access?

Relay: Responds to the question "Can you stop information existing in a twin to be replicated elsewhere?".
