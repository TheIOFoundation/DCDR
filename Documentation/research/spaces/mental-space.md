## About

A Mental Space (MS) is the representation of the Physical Space that every human has in their head. There are as many Mental Spaces are there are humans.

Each Mental Space is can be understood by a black box that runs an algorithm (MSA) over the data received through interaction with the Physical Space (MSD).

The algorithm (Mental Algorithm - MA) is composed, among others, by inherited mechanisms and learned knowledge.

The MS produces Mental Twins (MT) that represent the different objects we interact in the shape of models upon which we apply our MA.

Mental spaces are usually overlooked when interpreting the impact of technology. Nonetheless, the DCDR Framework relies on this concept to explain how certain mechanisms function.
