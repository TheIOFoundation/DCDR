The Physical Space (PS) is the environment inside which humans live. For all intents and purposes of this Framework, there is only one single Physical Spaces.

The Physical Space is regulated by laws of physics that we can discover and utilize for our benefit yet not modify.

The Physical Space produces objects, humans and otherwise. Humans organize in societies which handle the difficulties of managing groups of people through algorithms that we call laws.

Through the biology of their bodies, Humans create Mental Spaces.

Through the process of invention/innovation, Humans (through their Mental Spaces) create Digital Spaces.
