## About

The Physical Space (PS) is the representation of the Physical Space through the use of digital technology. There are as many Digital Spaces are there are digital systems.

Each Digital Space is composed of algorithms (DA) that represent actions applied over digital data (DD) that is either obtained by measuring a properly in the Physical Space (authentic data) or synthetically manufactured (non-authentic data).

The algorithms (Digital Algorithm - DA) are built through hardware and software with the former establishing the range of possibilities served to the user through the latter.

The DS produces Digital Twins (DT) that represent objects, both build with authentic and non-authentic (more often than not a combination of both), upon with DAs are applied.

For all intents and purposes of this Framework, there is only one single Physical Spaces are usually overlooked when interpreting the impact of technology. Nonetheless, the DCDR Framework relies on this concept to explain how certain mechanisms function.
