## About

A research focused on describing a taxonomy of data Use Cases on the basis of the DCDR Framework.

## The Use Cases Taxonomy

{% hint style="info" %}
The following components inform the work for the DCDR Use Cases Taxonomy:

* DCDR Framework
* Digital Harms
* Digital Rights
{% endhint %}

In order to understand how the DCDR Framework can be implemented in daily technology it is fundamental to analyze the different Use Cases that a data structure will go through its lifecycle and model them through the DCDR Components.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Use Cases Taxonomy enables the work on the UDDR's DR SDK.
{% endhint %}

### Defining a Use Case

\[Work in Progress]

### Licensing and distribution

As all materials created by The IO Foundation, the [Use Cases Taxonomy](https://tiof.click/DCDRUseCases), a component of the [DCDR Framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework), is published under TIOF Public Licensing Model.

### Revisions

The Use Cases Taxonomy, as any other component of the [DCDR advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRDocs), is subjected to improvements.

### How to contribute

Anyone wishing to submit an improvement to the Use Cases Taxonomy, can do so via the [Use Cases Taxonomy folder](https://tiof.click/DCDRUseCasesContribute) in the [DCDR repository](https://tiof.click/DCDRRepo).

## Outcomes

* Establish a working group to research on the Use Cases Taxonomy based on the [DCDR Framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework) and its components
* Produce a research paper documenting the Use Cases taxonomy
* Design a syllabus for the dissemination of the Use Cases taxonomy
* Promote the awareness and understanding of the research results
* Incorporate the research's results in the [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRDocs)
