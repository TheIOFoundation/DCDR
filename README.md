# About the DCDR Framework

Data-Centric Digital Rights (DCDR), an initiative from The IO Foundation, is a framework for technologists composed of Principles, Taxonomies and other technical tools. It enables them to develop a deeper understanding about the nature of data, the digital twins that emerge from it and make possible for them to embrace their role as NextGen Rights Defenders.

<code>By understanding that [_I am my data_](https://TIOF.Click/DCDRPrinciple1), technologists may design solutions that aim at [_ending remedy_](https://TIOF.Click/DCDRPrinciple2) by architecting and building technology that observers [_Rights by Design_](https://TIOF.Click/DCDRPrinciple3).</code>
